## What is Unstoppable?
Instead of building a DEX to compete with existing DEXs like Uniswap, Sushiswap, GMX, etc the Unstoppable:DEX builds on top of these proven liquidity sources to provide: 
- An advanced Spot trading experience, not seen on Uniswap/Sushiswap
- And a next-generation margin trading experience not possible on platforms like GMX.

### Spot
Unstoppable:DEX Spot provides all the advanced order types available on a CEX but rarely seen in DeFi.
- Buy & Sell Limit Orders
- Trailing Stop Loss
- DCA (Dollar-Cost-Average)
An exchange is only as good as the trades you can execute there. Traders must be able to trade in size without being exposed to excessive slippage or position constraints. Unstoppable:DEX enables this by aggregating existing deep liquidity sources.

### Margin
Unstoppable:DEX Margin provides unique solutions for margin trading by building on top of existing DeFi.

- liquidity and backing all our trades 1:1 with the underlying asset (borrowed from our LPs)
- providing safe and under-collateralized borrowing options for our traders.
  
When opening a trade instead of competing against LPs (like GMX) you are simply borrowing single-sided liquidity. This allows Unstoppable to back all leveraged trads 1:1 with spot assets. 
This design removes the need to keep Open Interest balanced like on other platforms, meaning there are no Open Interest caps or position size limits for our traders.

# 1. Wrong accounting of the storage balances results for the protocol to be in debt even when the bad debt is repaid.
## Summary
Wrong accounting of the storage balances results for the protocol to be in debt even when the bad debt is repaid.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a position is fully closed, it can result to accruing bad debt or being in profit and repaying the borrowed liquidity which all depends on the amount_out_received from the swap.

In a bad debt scenario the function calculates the bad debt and accrues it based on the difference between the position debt and the amount out received from the swap. And after that repays the liquidity providers with the same received amount from the swap.

```vy
    if amount_out_received >= position_debt_amount:
        # all good, LPs are paid back, remainder goes back to trader
        trader_pnl: uint256 = amount_out_received - position_debt_amount
        self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] += trader_pnl
        self._repay(position.debt_token, position_debt_amount)
    else:
        # edge case: bad debt
        self.is_accepting_new_orders = False  # put protocol in defensive mode
        bad_debt: uint256 = position_debt_amount - amount_out_received
        self.bad_debt[position.debt_token] += bad_debt
        self._repay(
            position.debt_token, amount_out_received
        )  # repay LPs as much as possible
        log BadDebt(position.debt_token, bad_debt, position.uid)
```

The mapping total_debt_amount holds all debt borrowed from users, and this amount accrues interest with the time.

Prior to closing a position, the bad debt is calculated and accrued to the mapping bad_debt, but it isn't subtracted from the mapping total_debt_amount which holds all the debt even the bad one accrued through the time. 

```vy
@internal
def _update_debt(_debt_token: address):
    """
    @notice
        Accounts for any accrued interest since the last update.
    """
    if block.timestamp == self.last_debt_update[_debt_token]:
        return  # already up to date, nothing to do

    self.last_debt_update[_debt_token] = block.timestamp
    
    if self.total_debt_amount[_debt_token] == 0:
        return # no debt, no interest

    self.total_debt_amount[_debt_token] += self._debt_interest_since_last_update(
        _debt_token
    )
```

As the bad debt isn't subtracted from the total_debt_amount when closing a position, even after repaying the bad debt. It will still be in the total_debt_amount, which will prevent the full withdrawing of the liquidity funds.
```vy
@nonreentrant("lock")
@external
def repay_bad_debt(_token: address, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to repay bad_debt in case it was accrued.
    """
    self.bad_debt[_token] -= _amount
    self._safe_transfer_from(_token, msg.sender, self, _amount)
```
```vy
@internal
@view
def _available_liquidity(_token: address) -> uint256:
    return self._total_liquidity(_token) - self.total_debt_amount[_token]
```
```vy
@internal
@view
def _total_liquidity(_token: address) -> uint256:
    return (
        self.base_lp_total_amount[_token]
        + self.safety_module_lp_total_amount[_token]
        - self.bad_debt[_token]
    )
```

## Impact
The issue leads to liquidity providers unable to withdraw their full amount of funds, as even after repaying the bad debt it will still be in the total_debt_amount mapping.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The only way to fix this problem is to repay the position debt amount prior to closing a position and not only the received amount from the swap. Because total_debt_amount holds the bad debt as well.

```vy
    else:
        # edge case: bad debt
        self.is_accepting_new_orders = False  # put protocol in defensive mode
        bad_debt: uint256 = position_debt_amount - amount_out_received
        self.bad_debt[position.debt_token] += bad_debt
        self._repay(
            position.debt_token, position_debt_amount
        )  # repay LPs as much as possible
        log BadDebt(position.debt_token, bad_debt, position.uid)

```

# 2. Stuck funds in the vault duo to wrong logic applied when adding margin to a position.
## Summary
Stuck funds in the vault duo to wrong logic applied when adding margin to a position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function add_margin is used by user to reduce the leverage of the position, by adding margin to it. 

By using the function, the position's margin amount is updated with the new amount added, so that the position's leverage doesn't exceed the max leverage allowed and the function isn't eligible for liquidation. 

Once added this margin can't be removed from the position if it gets the position back in liquidation state.

```vy
@external
def add_margin(_position_uid: bytes32, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to add additional margin to a Position and 
        reduce the leverage.
    """
    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]

    assert (self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] >= _amount), "not enough margin"

    self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] -= _amount
    position.margin_amount += _amount

    self.positions[_position_uid] = position
    log MarginAdded(_position_uid, _amount)
```
```vy
@external
def remove_margin(_position_uid: bytes32, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to remove margin from a Position and 
        increase the leverage.
    """
    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]

    assert position.margin_amount >= _amount, "not enough margin"

    position.margin_amount -= _amount
    self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] += _amount

    assert not self._is_liquidatable(_position_uid), "exceeds max leverage"
    
    self.positions[_position_uid] = position
    log MarginRemoved(_position_uid, _amount)
```

The only choice would be to close or partially close the position.

But if we look over the function we can see that the margin amount isn't accounted anywhere.

Fully closing the position: Even tho margin was added the position_amount stays the same, so the function doesn't count it and still process the closing with the old values. At the end the extra margin added is being deleted with the position, which means that the funds are stuck in the contract.

Partially closing the position: On the other hand partially closing counts the margin amount and calculates the debt ratio based on the new amount of margin, but still do the closing based on the old leverage before the extra margin was added. Which leads to the same stuck funds in the contract as fully closing the position.

The conclusion is that adding margin to the position can reduce the leverage of the position, so the position is not eligible for liquidation, but closing the position is still based on the old leverage before the extra margin was added to the position. In the end when closing the positions, these extra funds added to the position are not included anywhere   and are stuck in the contract.

# 3. Check if position is still liquidatable is not made when adding margin.
## Summary
Check if position is still liquidatable is not made when adding margin.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the function add_margin is used to reduce the leverage of a position by adding more margin to the position.
However the function forgets to check whether the position is still exceeds the maximum allowed leverage even after adding margin to the position.

This is problematic considering that the position is still eligible for liquidation, given this scenario if a user adds an amount of margin but the margin is not enough to reduce the leverage below the maximum allowed leverage. The user's position can still be liquidated, which results for the user to lose the extra margin he added to the position.

```vy
@external
def add_margin(_position_uid: bytes32, _amount: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Allows to add additional margin to a Position and 
        reduce the leverage.
    """
    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]

    assert (self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] >= _amount), "not enough margin"

    self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] -= _amount
    position.margin_amount += _amount

    self.positions[_position_uid] = position
    log MarginAdded(_position_uid, _amount)
```

## Impact
By not checking if the position is still liquidatable even after adding margin to it, an user can still be liquidated resulting to him losing the extra margin of funds added to the position.

    self.positions[_position_uid] = position

```

# 4. A position exceeding the max leverage should only be fully closed through liquidation.
## Summary
A position exceeding the max leverage should only be fully closed through liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail
When position's values exceed the maximum allowed leverage in the market, the position is available for liquidation.

```vy
@view
@internal
def _is_liquidatable(_position_uid: bytes32) -> bool:
    """

    leverage: uint256 = self._effective_leverage(_position_uid)
    return leverage > self.max_leverage[position.debt_token][position.position_token]
```

Prior to liquidating a position exceeding the maximum leverage, the owner of the position is charged a liquidation penalty incase the amount out received is bigger than the debt accrued.

```vy

    assert self.is_whitelisted_dex[msg.sender], "unauthorized"
    assert self._is_liquidatable(_position_uid), "position not liquidateable"

    position: Position = self.positions[_position_uid]
    debt_amount: uint256 = self._debt(_position_uid)

    min_amount_out: uint256 = self._market_order_min_amount_out(
        position.position_token, position.debt_token, position.position_amount
    )

    # penalize account
    penalty: uint256 = debt_amount * self.liquidation_penalty / PERCENTAGE_BASE

    if amount_out_received > debt_amount:
        # margin left
        remaining_margin: uint256 = amount_out_received - debt_amount
        penalty = min(penalty, remaining_margin)
        self.margin[position.account][position.debt_token] -= penalty
        self._distribute_trading_fee(position.debt_token, penalty)

    log PositionLiquidated(position.account, _position_uid, position)

```

Currently when a position is eligible for liquidation, the owner is restricted from partially reducing the position's amount but the same restriction is not applied when closing the whole position with the function "def close_position".

When liquidating the position a penalty is issued duo to the owner of the position exceeding the maximum leverage allowed, this penalty shouldn't by bypassed by the owner closing the position himself. Therefore when a position is liquidatable, the only way for the position to be fully closed should be through liquidation.

# 5. Order's minimum amount out is calculated wrongly when partially closing a position.
## Summary
Order's minimum amount out is calculated wrongly when partially closing a position.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user partially closes a position, the user can either set the wanted _min_amount_out by himself or apply "_min_amount_out" as zero and let the function calculate the minimum amount out itself based on the position's info.

However the function makes the mistake to calculate the minimum amount out based on the whole position amount instead of calculating it based on the amount that the user wants to reduce the position for e.g - "_reduce_by_amount".

In the end the minimum amount out calculated by the function will be never met, as the user is partially closing an amount from the position and not closing the full amount of the position. Therefore this feature leads to permanent revert.

```

## Impact
Duo to the logic error, the minimum amount calculated by the function will be incorrect which leads to the permanent revert of this feature.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As the function reduce_position is used to partially close a position, the min amount out should be calculated based on the user's _reduce_by_amount and not the whole position amount. As this problem leads to the incorrect calculation of the minimum amount out.

```vy
    min_amount_out: uint256 = _min_amount_out
    if min_amount_out == 0:
        # market order, add some slippage protection
        min_amount_out = self._market_order_min_amount_out(
            position.position_token, position.debt_token, _reduce_by_amount
        )

```
